# Vulnerability Chainer (/mantis-chain)

## System Goal

Exploit Chain Architect. Analyzes isolated, individually-validated security
findings and historical knowledge base primitives to identify and construct
complex, multi-step exploit chains.

## Command Definition

-   **Command:** `/mantis-chain`
-   **Description:** Analyzes individual security findings to identify and
    construct complex exploit chains.

## Input/Output Contract

-   **Reads**:
    -   `workspace/findings/` (validated finding JSON files where status is
        `"VALID"`, and viability is `"VIABLE"`, `"CONDITIONAL_VIABLE"`, or
        `"SAMPLE_OR_TEST"`).
    -   `workspace/kb/entities/*.md` and `workspace/kb/vulnerabilities/*.md`
        (knowledge base primitives).
    -   `workspace/.mantis_state.json` (to track current loop pass).
-   **Writes**:
    -   Net-new exploit chain finding JSON files to
        `workspace/findings/<new_uuid>.json`. Original findings are left
        unmodified.
-   **Preconditions**:
    -   Validated or viable findings must exist in `workspace/findings/`.
-   **Idempotency Guarantee**:
    -   Before writing a new exploit chain finding, the skill must check
        existing exploit chain findings in `workspace/findings/` by comparing
        the constituent finding UUIDs. If a chain finding with the exact same
        constituent UUID sequence already exists, it must skip creating a
        duplicate.

## Instructions

Read the current batch of validated findings and explore whether multiple
seemingly low-severity or disparate vulnerabilities can be sequentially combined
to achieve a higher-impact compromise.

Execute the chaining stage as follows:

1.  **Load Primitives & Validated Findings:**

    -   Read the JSON files in the `workspace/findings/` directory. Filter for
        findings that have passed validation (e.g., status is `"VALID"` and
        viability is `"VIABLE"`, `"CONDITIONAL_VIABLE"`, or `"SAMPLE_OR_TEST"`).
    -   Read the Markdown Knowledge Base (`workspace/kb/entities/` and
        `workspace/kb/vulnerabilities/`) to identify architectural primitives
        that might not be bugs on their own, but could serve as stepping stones
        (e.g., "User controls file upload path", "Service runs as root").

2.  **Cross-Finding Analysis (The Chaining Matrix):**

    -   Analyze the preconditions and postconditions of each validated finding.
    -   Ask: *Can the output or side-effect of Finding A satisfy the strict
        precondition required to trigger Finding B?*
    -   Example Chains to look for:
        -   **Path Traversal + Loose Permissions = RCE:** A low-severity path
            traversal (Finding A) allows writing to `/tmp`, but a separate
            misconfiguration (Finding B) allows a cron job to execute scripts in
            `/tmp`.
        -   **XSS + CSRF = Account Takeover:** A stored XSS (Finding A) can be
            used to harvest an anti-CSRF token to execute a state-changing
            action (Finding B).
        -   **Info Leak (Memory Revelation) + Buffer Overflow = ASLR Bypass:**
            An info leak (Finding A) reveals base pointers, satisfying the
            precondition to exploit a stack buffer overflow (Finding B).

3.  **Construct "Super Findings":**

    -   If a viable exploit chain is discovered, do **NOT** modify or delete the
        original isolated findings. They still need to be patched individually.
    -   Instead, generate a **net-new UUID** and create a new finding JSON file
        in `workspace/findings/<new_uuid>.json`.
    -   **Constituent Findings**: You must record the array of constituent
        finding UUIDs in the structured `"constituent_findings"` property (e.g.,
        `["UUID_A", "UUID_B"]`). This clearly documents the links of the exploit
        chain.
    -   **Determine Entry Point Privileges**: The `privileges_required` field
        for the chain must represent the privilege level required to initiate
        the *first* step of the chain (the entry point). For example, if the
        chain starts with an unauthenticated exploit (NONE) that leads to admin
        access, which is then used to trigger RCE, the chain's
        `privileges_required` must be set to `NONE`.
    -   **Determine Attacker Position**: The `attacker_position` field for the
        chain must inherit the attacker position from the entry point / first
        constituent finding of the chain.
    -   **Determine User Interaction Requirement**: The `user_interaction` field
        for the chain must be set to `REQUIRED` if the entry point or any step
        in the chain requires user interaction. It should only be set to `NONE`
        if the entire chain is zero-click.
    -   **Determine Status**: Set `status` to `"VALID"`.
    -   **Determine Production Viability**: Inherit from constituent findings.
        If any constituent is `"SAMPLE_OR_TEST"`, set to `"SAMPLE_OR_TEST"`.
        Else if any constituent is `"CONDITIONAL_VIABLE"`, set to
        `"CONDITIONAL_VIABLE"`. Otherwise, set to `"VIABLE"`.
    -   **Determine Reproduction Status**: Inherit from constituent findings:
        -   If any constituent has a `repro_status` of `"failed_to_reproduce"`
            or `"not_attempted"`, set to `"not_attempted"`.
        -   Otherwise, if all constituents have a `repro_status` of
            `"reproduced"` or `"statically_confirmed"`, set to
            `"statically_confirmed"`.
        -   An exploit chain must **never** inherit `"reproduced"` (as
            reproduction of constituents does not prove the end-to-end chain
            works).

    ### Chain Findings Schema Format (Per File)

    ```json
    {
      "id": "A unique identifier generated for this chain finding. Must match filename.",
      "title": "Exploit Chain: [Impact] via [Finding A] and [Finding B]",
      "description": "Step-by-step documentation of the exploit chain. Start with Step 1 (Triggering Finding A) and explain how its outcome feeds into Step N (Triggering Finding Z).",
      "impact": "The combined, escalated impact of the chain (e.g., Remote Code Execution, Full Database Exfiltration). This should be higher than the individual findings.",
      "severity": "CRITICAL / HIGH",
      "privileges_required": "NONE / LOW / HIGH",
      "user_interaction": "NONE / REQUIRED",
      "code_paths": [
        "relative/file/path_A.c:line_number",
        "relative/file/path_B.c:line_number"
      ],
      "attacker_position": "EXTERNAL / LOCAL / etc. (inherited from entry point)",
      "mitigation": "Recommended strategy to break the chain. Usually involves fixing at least one, if not all, of the underlying links.",
      "status": "VALID",
      "production_viability": "VIABLE / SAMPLE_OR_TEST / CONDITIONAL_VIABLE",
      "repro_status": "statically_confirmed / not_attempted",
      "constituent_findings": ["UUID_A", "UUID_B"],
      "history": [
        {
          "stage": "chainer",
          "action": "created",
          "details": "Constructed by chaining findings [UUID_A] and [UUID_B].",
          "pass_number": <current_pass_number>,
          "timestamp": "<current_iso8601_timestamp>"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

4.  **Chain Deduplication Tagging:**

    -   To ensure `/mantis-dedupe` treats these chains differently than raw
        findings, ensure the word "Chain" is prominently featured in the
        `"title"` and `"history"` fields as shown in the schema.

Ensure any newly constructed chain files are written to the
`workspace/findings/` directory. When complete, notify the user.
