# Architect (/mantis-architecture)

## System Goal

Knowledge Base Synthesizer. Translates ephemeral insights from the learnings
queue (`workspace/learnings.jsonl`) and structural analysis of the codebase into
a canonical, interlinked Markdown Knowledge Base (`workspace/kb/`).

## Command Definition

-   **Command:** `/mantis-architecture`
-   **Description:** Builds the foundation of the KB by defining system
    architecture, mapping specific entities (components), and categorizing
    historical vulnerability patterns.

## Input/Output Contract

-   **Reads**:
    -   `workspace/learnings.jsonl` (raw insights from the current round).
    -   `workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl` (optional, past vulnerability
        metadata).
    -   Codebase directory structure and key source files.
    -   Existing Markdown files in `workspace/kb/` (to validate/decay check).
    -   `workspace/.mantis_state.json` (to retrieve pass count).
-   **Writes**:
    -   Markdown files under `workspace/kb/` (`architecture.md`,
        `entities/[component_name].md`, `vulnerabilities/[CWE-ID].md`,
        `index.md`).
    -   Archives `workspace/learnings.jsonl` to
        `workspace/archive/learnings/learnings_pass_${N}_${X}.jsonl`.
-   **Preconditions**:
    -   `workspace/learnings.jsonl` must exist.
-   **Idempotency Guarantee**:
    -   Transactional: moves `workspace/learnings.jsonl` to archive only after
        programmatically verifying all KB Markdown updates were written
        successfully. KB files are overwritten in-place.

## Instructions

Analyze the codebase and pending learnings to construct a permanent,
Markdown-based memory for future agents.

Execute the architecture stage as follows:

1.  **Read the Inbox (`workspace/learnings.jsonl` and
    `workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl`):**

    -   Parse the contents of `workspace/learnings.jsonl` (and
        `workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl` if it exists). Extract all
        trajectory insights, discovered vulnerabilities, viable crash paths, and
        verified patches.

2.  **Analyze Source Code Boundaries:**

    -   Examine the directory structure and key source files. Dynamically
        identify the core components, interfaces, and trust boundaries of the
        system based on the repository's contents. This applies broadly across
        domains: whether it is a software system (e.g., identifying parsers,
        controllers, or network daemons), a hardware/RTL design (e.g.,
        identifying IP blocks, JTAG interfaces, or memory controllers),
        Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g., identifying cloud permissions, VPC
        perimeters, or deployment descriptors), or data/ML pipelines (e.g.,
        identifying data ingress points, model serialization mechanisms, or
        training boundaries).

3.  **Build or Update the Knowledge Base (KB):**

    -   Create or update files in the `workspace/kb/` directory using standard
        Markdown. Follow these strict paths:

        -   `workspace/kb/architecture.md`: High-level data flows, zone
            definitions, system design, and overall availability/uptime
            requirements (if documented or inferable from configuration like
            systemd, kubernetes, or load balancers).
        -   `workspace/kb/entities/[component_name].md`: Specific definitions
            for components (e.g., `auth_module.md`). Must include links to
            associated vulnerability classes and document known constraints
            (e.g., "This module sanitizes input X"). Document the component's
            criticality and availability requirements (classify as CRITICAL,
            STANDARD, or LOW_CRITICALITY if applicable). Incorporate trajectory
            insights here.
        -   `workspace/kb/vulnerabilities/[CWE-ID_or_BugClass].md`: Descriptions
            of bug classes (e.g., `CWE-79.md` or `Memory-Corruption.md`) that
            have been historically relevant to this codebase, including examples
            of what *not* to do.
        -   `workspace/kb/index.md`: A root catalog containing links and 1-line
            summaries to every file created above. This is the map the Planner
            will read.

    -   **Important Formatting Rules:** Use relative links to cross-reference
        entities and vulnerabilities (e.g., `[Auth
        Module](entities/auth_module.md)`). Ensure all markdown files are
        concise and focused on actionable security context.

4.  **Validate and Decay Knowledge (Drift Prevention):**

    -   Knowledge becomes stale when code is patched or refactored. Before
        finalizing the KB updates, spot-check the assertions in the existing
        `workspace/kb/entities/` against the live source code.
    -   If an entity file claims a variable is un-sanitized (based on an old
        learning) but the live code now contains a sanitization function
        (because a patch landed), **delete or correct that outdated learning**
        in the KB.
    -   If a learning is repeatedly proven wrong by the current trajectory
        insights, actively correct it to prevent the "wrong learning" from
        persisting and blinding future agents.

5.  **Transactional Inbox Clearing & Archiving:**

    -   To prevent infinite loops and token bloat, you must clear the queue and
        archive the learnings.
    -   **Verify and Finalize:** Programmatically verify that all Markdown KB
        updates were successfully written to disk and that cross-references are
        valid.
    -   **Commit by Moving:** Only after verifying synthesis success, move
        `workspace/learnings.jsonl` to the archive directory:
        -   Ensure the target directory exists (e.g., `mkdir -p
            workspace/archive/learnings/`).
        -   Determine the loop pass number `N` by reading `"pass_number"` from
            `workspace/.mantis_state.json`. If missing or invalid, scan
            `workspace/archive/` for folders matching `findings_pass_N` or
            `loopN_findings` and resolve `N` to `max_found + 1`, defaulting to 1
            if no archives exist.
        -   Determine the sub-index `X` by counting existing files matching
            `learnings_pass_${N}_*.jsonl` in `workspace/archive/learnings/` and
            adding 1.
        -   Move the file: `mv workspace/learnings.jsonl
            workspace/archive/learnings/learnings_pass_${N}_${X}.jsonl`.
    -   If synthesis fails or is interrupted, leave `workspace/learnings.jsonl`
        intact in its original location to ensure no data is lost.

When complete, notify the user.
