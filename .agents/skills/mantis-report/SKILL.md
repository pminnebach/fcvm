# Reporter (/mantis-report)

## System Goal

Security Reporting Expert. Synthesizes complex, technical finding logs into a
high-quality, human-readable review packet for developers and stakeholders.

## Command Definition

-   **Command:** `/mantis-report`
-   **Description:** Generates a human-readable security review packet
    containing only reproduced findings.

## Input/Output Contract

-   **Reads**:
    -   `workspace/findings/*.json` (all finding files).
    -   `workspace/.mantis_state.json` (to track current loop pass).
-   **Writes**:
    -   `workspace/report/review_packet_pass_<N>.md` (pass-numbered markdown
        report).
    -   Updates copy/symlink at `workspace/report/review_packet-latest.md`.
-   **Preconditions**:
    -   Calibrated and reproduced findings exist in `workspace/findings/`.
-   **Idempotency Guarantee**:
    -   Writes to pass-numbered files. In-place overwrite of
        `review_packet-latest.md`. Since it reads the pass number from the
        state, re-running the same pass updates the same pass report rather than
        generating a new pass number.

## Instructions

Compile a professional Markdown report detailing only the verified and
reproduced vulnerabilities.

Execute the reporting stage as follows:

1.  **Load and Filter Findings:**

    -   Read all JSON files from the `workspace/findings/` directory.
    -   **Strict Filter:** Include only actionable findings. You MUST include:
        1.  Findings where `repro_status` is `"reproduced"`.
        2.  Findings where `repro_status` is `"statically_confirmed"` BUT
            contain valid external stack traces, sanitizer traces (e.g.
            ASan/UBSan), or crash logs proving empirical execution impact
            (treated as empirically reproduced by calibration).
        3.  Valid Exploit Chains (constructed by the chainer, identified by
            "Exploit Chain" in the title, or history, or if the
            "constituent_findings" property is present and non-empty) even if
            they inherited a status of `"statically_confirmed"`. Do **not**
            include false positives, non-viable findings, findings that failed
            to reproduce, or ordinary statically confirmed findings that lack
            empirical execution traces.
    -   **Severity Filtering:** Exclude findings with a priority of `"LOW"` from
        the main report body. You must place these lower-priority issues into a
        separate, dedicated "Appendix: Low Priority Findings" section at the
        very end of the report, keeping the main report focused on high-risk
        issues.

2.  **Extract Key Artifacts:** For each reproduced finding, extract and format:

    -   **Header Metadata:** Title, ID (UUID), Inferred Exposure, Final Risk
        Score, and Qualitative Priority.
    -   **Vulnerability Description & Impact:** A clear explanation of the bug
        and the concrete impact on the system.
    -   **Reproduction Evidence:**
        -   The PoC script path (`repro_file_path`) and execution command
            (`run_command`).
        -   A clean snippet of the stdout/stderr showing the successful exploit
            trigger (`repro_output`).
    -   **Risk Rationale:** The independent validation reasoning (`reasoning`),
        production viability reasoning (`critic_reasoning`), and outrage factor
        analysis (`outrage_commentary`).
    -   **Remediation & Patch:**
        -   The recommended mitigation strategy.
        -   The verified patch diff (`patch_diff`) and re-attack status to prove
            the fix is resilient.
    -   **PII & Secrets Redaction:** Before writing any finding data (including
        description, PoC script/command, and reproducer logs) to the report, you
        **must** scan and redact any hardcoded API keys, tokens, credentials,
        PII (names, emails, phone numbers), internal hostnames/domain names, and
        overly weaponized payload parameters, replacing them with standard
        placeholders like `<REDACTED_SECRET>`, `<REDACTED_PII>`,
        `<REDACTED_INTERNAL_HOST>`, or `<REDACTED_PAYLOAD>` to ensure the report
        is safe for broader distribution.

3.  **Generate Review Packet:**

    -   **Grouping by Patch Status:** Organize the Executive Summary table and
        the main body of the report by grouping findings into three distinct
        sections based on their remediation status:
        1.  **Patch Independently Verified:** Findings where `patch_status` is
            `"VERIFIED_SECURE"` (meaning the patch was successfully verified and
            passed variant re-attack checks).
        2.  **Patch Proposed:** Findings that contain a `patch_diff` but
            `patch_status` is NOT `"VERIFIED_SECURE"`.
        3.  **Unpatched:** Findings with no `patch_diff` present, or where
            `patch_status` is `"VERIFICATION_FAILED"` or `"ERROR"`.
    -   **Pass-Numbered Output:** Do not overwrite the same `review_packet.md`
        file on every execution. Instead, determine the current run/pass number
        `N` of the pipeline (resolved from `"pass_number"` in
        `workspace/.mantis_state.json`. If missing or invalid, scan
        `workspace/archive/` for folders matching `findings_pass_N` or
        `loopN_findings` and resolve `N` to `max_found + 1`, defaulting to 1 if
        no archives exist). Write the report to a pass-numbered file:
        `workspace/report/review_packet_pass_<N>.md` (where `<N>` is the
        sequential pass number, e.g., `review_packet_pass_1.md`).
    -   **Latest Copy/Symlink:** After writing the pass-numbered report, update
        a symlink or write a copy of the file to
        `workspace/report/review_packet-latest.md` pointing/copying to the
        newest pass report, so that the latest version is always reachable.
    -   Use clean, professional Markdown formatting with clear headers, tables
        for metadata, and syntax-highlighted code blocks for logs and diffs.
    -   Include a high-level **Executive Summary** table at the top listing all
        included findings, their priority, and their risk scores.

When complete, notify the user.
