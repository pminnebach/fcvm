# Summarizer (/mantis-summarize)

## System Goal

Repository Mapper. Automates the generation of security-focused, deterministic
summaries of directory contents to reduce token overhead for downstream planning
and research stages.

## Command Definition

-   **Command:** `/mantis-summarize`
-   **Description:** Pre-processes the repository by generating security-focused
    summaries (`mantis-summary.md`) for each directory to make planning and
    research more efficient.

## Input/Output Contract

-   **Reads**:
    -   `workspace/.mantis_state.json` (to track current loop pass).
    -   Codebase directories and source files (excluding `node_modules`,
        `vendor`, `.git`, build outputs, and `tests/`).
    -   Child directory summaries (`mantis-summary.md` files from
        subdirectories).
    -   `workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl` (optional, to enrich summaries).
-   **Writes**:
    -   Traversal script to workspace.
    -   `mantis-summary.md` file in each directory containing source code.
-   **Preconditions**:
    -   Source files and directory structure must be present.
-   **Idempotency Guarantee**:
    -   Deterministically overwrites existing `mantis-summary.md` files in-place
        with updated rollups.

## Instructions

Your task is to write and execute a script that will traverse the repository
directory tree and create a `mantis-summary.md` file in each directory
containing source code.

This is an **optional pre-processing phase** designed to drastically reduce the
context window size required for the strategist (`/mantis-plan`), and provide a
quick reference map for researchers (`/mantis-researcher`) and threat model
generator (`/mantis-threat-model`).

Execute the summarize stage as follows:

1.  **Write the Traversal Script (Bottom-Up Hierarchical):** Write a script
    (e.g., Python or bash) in your workspace that walks the repository directory
    tree using a **bottom-up (post-order) traversal**.

    -   The script must ignore non-source-code directories such as
        `node_modules`, `vendor`, `.git`, build outputs, and `tests/`.
    -   By traversing bottom-up, the script ensures that subdirectories are
        summarized *before* their parent directories.
    -   When analyzing a directory, the script should pass the LLM the local
        source files in that directory **PLUS** the `mantis-summary.md` files of
        its immediate subdirectories. Do not pass the raw source files of
        subdirectories to the parent.
    -   When analyzing very large directories, context window size might become
        a problem. Instead of passing files and directory summaries in bulk,
        generate per-file summaries or operate in more efficient chunks to avoid
        passing too many tokens for the LLM to handle.

2.  **Generate the Security Summary (Map-Reduce):** The script should read
    `workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl` (if it exists) to check for past
    vulnerabilities and security fixes associated with files in the current
    directory, and pass them in context. The script should instruct the LLM or
    agent tool to generate a concise, security-focused summary of the directory.
    To keep token lengths reasonable at higher levels of the directory tree, the
    LLM should abstract away lower-level details, focusing on the rolled-up
    architecture. The prompt used by your script should ask for:

    -   **Core Components:** What are the primary files and subdirectories, and
        what do they do?
    -   **API Endpoints & Exports:** What functions or classes are exposed to
        other modules?
    -   **Trust Boundaries & External Inputs:** Does this directory handle
        untrusted data, network requests, or user input?
    -   **Sensitive Operations:** Are there parsers, cryptographic functions, or
        memory management operations?
    -   **Historical Vulnerabilities & Fixes:** What files or components in this
        directory have historical vulnerabilities or security-related fixes
        recorded in `workspace/historical_learnings.jsonl`? Summarize the past
        fixes, components affected, and vulnerability classes to highlight past
        regressions or recurring weaknesses.

    The summary must be a reasonable size to incorporate into work on larger
    problems, so aim for several thousand words or fewer.

3.  **Output to `mantis-summary.md`:** The script must write the resulting
    summary into a file named `mantis-summary.md` inside the corresponding
    directory. Overwrite it if it already exists.

4.  **Execute the Script:** Run the script you just wrote to generate all the
    summaries across the repository. Wait for it to finish successfully.

When complete, notify the user.
